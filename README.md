# RPS Remote Simulator

I know you are probably wondering what RPS means.
It is a highly dedicated **Monte-Carlo Simulation** of probabilistic sampling values, trained and pipelined to run on a fastapi endpoint constructor, serving responses to routes for the game of Rock Paper Scissors.
Yes, Rock Paper Scissors, what did you think it was going to be? And I am proud I made you all that. I will not be hosting this masterpiece, but you can test it out on your local machine.
